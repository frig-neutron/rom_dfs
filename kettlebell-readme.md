INTRO

Hi all, I'd like to talk about my experience picking up a kettlebell practice, which I'm a bit over 6 months into by now.

I'll 
 - give a quick definition of kettlebells
 - give my backstory with them, 
 - mention some of the practical concerns I needed to adress, and
 - talk about why I chose this practice and why I find it interesting

## Kettlebell intro

This is a kettlebell: 

PIC OF KETTLEBELL

The shape is classic - like many physical training implements and martial weapons, the shape is a utilitarian one. These types of weights were used in agriculture as units of measurement.

PIC OF STRONGMAN WITH KETTLEBELL 

Records of people using these types of things for feats of strength go back centuries, and in many countries.

SOVIET TRAINING PIC

The formalization of a kettlebell sport occurred within the Soviet Union, mostly during the 1950, 1960s, and 1970s.

TERMS
 - "Girya = pic of kettlebell"
 - Pood = 16 Kg = 35 lb

As the sport came out of Russia, so does much of its terminology. The Russian term for "kettlebell" is "girya", so the terms "girya" and "girevoy sport" have been absorbed into the international sport lexicon. 

The units of weight themselves also come from russian folk tradition, and goes back to the use of the kettlebell in agriculture. 

The "pood" is an arcane unit of weight, akin to the the british "slug". One pood is roughly 16 kg, or 35 lb.

Many kettlebells today come in some multiple of pood-derived weight.

## Enter the n00b 

I first picked up a kettlebell in a group class at a gym. I've never spent much time at gyms as I've tended to rely on martial arts and yoga classes for my fitness, but that was all pre-covid and after a couple of years of following videos in my living room I wanted to do something different. So I signed up for a regular interval training class during the covid lull we had between the delta and omicron waves. 

Cases were down, vaccines were working, and the covid felt over.

----

PIC OF RUSSIAN TRAINING SWINGS

The class circuit included kettlebell swings. I picked up the kettlebell in front of me, looked at what everyone else was doing, and started swinging. The group instructor was upon me in an instant. Evidently, I was doing something wrong. I corrected the mistake, took a couple more swings. He corrected me again. I swung again. He corrected. A couple more cycles of this, and the instructor walked away from me, looking dissatisfied. 

All this left me with the impression that were things to know about this device and that I didn't know them. Soon enough the covid situation got too "hot" for my personal risk tolerance and I retreated back into my living room for more yoga videos.

----

I kept thinking about the kettlebell though. I wanted to learn something about them - figure out what was going wrong during that gym class, and what it would feel like to do it right. 

I was concerned about intoducing this type of object into my apartment, though. 

---

PICTURES OF BROKEN THINGS

Kettlebells in use go flying all over the place and I was concerned that I might send it flying through a window, embed it into a wall or a floor, take out a laptop or a person. Mass was a concern: how much do I need for the exerice to be worth-while? What if it's too much for me to handle? 


---

Finding space to keep the actual kettlebells between practice was also a concern. My apartment isn't huge, plus I didn't want to have a weight rack standing prominently in my living room. I could find space for one or two bells, but not for a full set.


My solution to that was a mass-adjustable kettlebell. I showroomed around sports stores for a bit, watched a lot of youtube comparisons of models and design styles. Eventually I settled on this unassuming little thing: 

---

EMBED PIC. It goes from 18-35lb. So I got it.

### MY RULES FOR STARTING

 - always swing in front of something soft and padded
 - swing with two hands 
 - do not train to failure 
 - limit weight

I also set some ground rules for practice. I would only swing the bell with two hands, and in front of couches or beds - somewhere it can go flying without harm. I would not lift more than X amount of weight over my head. Over time as I built up comfort and intuition, most of those rules all went away. I have a much better understanding of my capacity now, so I can make informed choices about safety on a case-by-case basis. This took a while to build up, though.

### REASONS

And _why_ did I choose kettlebell training as my training modality over all the other options, like running and yoga and solo bjj. Here the landscape complexifies - there's lots of exercise science out there and I don't claim to understand it. 

### FUN

... so I guess the main reason I stick with this type of training is I find it fun. It's accessible - the equipment requirements are minimal. 

- The potential for geekery is massive - kettlebell training is highly technical so there's no end to the refinement of technique you can engage in. 
- In this way the practice mirrors martial arts, where practitioners can spend decades discovering new aspects to familiar techniques.

There are a lot of resources dedicated to learning kettlebell training on your own. My advice would be to skip it and to get some 1:1 instruction. 


While my self-guided exploration of the kettlespace yielded results that I am proud of, in my first month with a 1:1 instructor I made more progress than I had all my 5 months of self-study. I've since acquired a second, bigger, better kettlebell:) 

---

PIC OF 1-ON-1 instruction

I'd like to emphasize the 1-on-1 component of this. Group instruction classes while great for stoking motivation, do not allow for all that much individualized attention. The instructor is required to divide their attention among all class participants, so if you don't get something that needs working through - chances are you're on your own. 

Just a few private lessons can make a great deal of difference to a n00b.

SCREENSHOT OF GOOGLE MAPS "kettlebell" SEARCH

How does one go about finding and choosing an instructor? Search for kettlebell instruction on Google Maps and you will find a rash of gyms offering services. Undoubtedly many of them have knowledgeable, experienced instructors on staff, but which ones, and how good of an instructor do you really need with all your n00bness? 

---

PIC OF SPINE XRAY

Well, you need to avoid injury. In my humble opinion, the knowledge to guide a total newcomer of an uncertain fitness and physiological integrity status through a challenging practice is the primary qualifying attribute of an instructor you should seek. That's not simple. Injuries can be acute, but they can also be cumulative. Muscle regenerates in days or weeks, connective tissues takes months. Stressing connective tissues in your limbs, torso, and spine with poor technique under load can feel fine for a good long while - until you have a bad day. 

Having someone who knows what they're doing watch your form goes a long way to managage that risk. Ideally the instructor has seen dozens of n00bs just like yourself take up the practice. They can see where you'll be in a few months by watching your progress now. 

---

PIC: RKC/SFG

So how _does_ one find such an instructor? I chose to look for a qualified practitioner lists from a certifying body. The two main certifying organizations I know of are RKC and StrongFirst. 

They used to be one org, but then StrongFirst split off in 2012 and took 80% of the teaching staff with them. 

From what I understand, the body of knowledge taught at both schools is similar. I used StrongFirst to put me in touch with one of their certified instructors in Montreal. 

I'd assume the CrossFit world has something similar set up, but I've never looked into it. 

---

CAVEAT 

I should amend a statement I made earlier - when I said that you should skip self-study and go for private instruction, I did not mean that you should skip it entirely. IMO self-study should supplement whatever training that you do. I gain a lot from listening to training podcasts, watching videos and trying things out on my own. The core of my practice is defined by the program an instructor put together for me, though.


### OUTTRO

So how do you actually use a kettlebell to train? Why would I give advice on that? I'm a n00b myself. 
Find an instructor. Find kettlebells. Do what the instructor tells you.
